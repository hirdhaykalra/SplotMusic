# Splot

Splot is a song forum for users to comment, share, and post about their favorite songs. A user is able to create posts to disscuss a song, comment on others post, and even follow other users.

This was started as a group project in a Software Engineering class (ITCS 3155) at UNC Charlotte. The original repository is here: https://github.com/thompaw/3155Project
-> check the contributors on that repo to see the original team.

## Features:
* Splot makes use of Google Sign-in as an option for users to log into the website.
* Splot uses Spotify's API to source 30-second previews of music.
* Splot's choice of web framework is Flask python, which helps power its backend. 
* Splot's makes use of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap's pre-made CSS templates for some design on the frontend and to bring that dark and high-contrast aesthetic to life.
* Splot makes use of sessions, so that people can't access pages they're not supposed to be on, or, create posts and edit and delete them only if they are the owner.

## Splot's Future:
As of May 11, 2022, the group project has ended.

However, I plan on continuing working on the project solo. I am exploring the option of single-page apps.

I also want to swap over to a Node.js based app, as it seems that it would make life easier with the Spotify API instead of having to use the web API wrapper library _Spotipy_

Updates on the project as well as a fresh repository will be posted here when available -> {{ not yet available }}
